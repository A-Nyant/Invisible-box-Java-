# Learning-Unity
This project was to create an invisible box. 
Here are a summary of the instructions
1) Create 3 colored boxes
2) place the boxes in random positions
3) Have the player click on a random location so that they can look for the boxes.
4) Depending on the boxes and how many they hit, they get points.
5) After they are done, display the points
6) Let the player reset the game and play again.
*Make sure that the player does not get points if they click on the box again.
